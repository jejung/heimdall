Contents

    * exploration.py - Initial data exploration an visualization. This script can be run as is to generate plots.
    * benchmark.py - Initial benchmark and pre-processing methods selection script. This script can be run passing the
    mode as argument 'benchmark' for benchmark part or 'datapreprocessing' as pre-processing selection. Notice that this
    is the final state of the script, for datapreprocessing an error will be thrown and this is expected since the last
    thing validated was the TruncatedSVD vectorizer that does not work with MultinomialNB
    * tests.py - Unit tests to ensure performance validation and functionality. Can be run as python -m unittest tests.py
    * utils.py - A collection of util functions used on benchmarks and validations
    * validation.py - The GMail validation script. Can be run as is, will open the browser and ask for authentication.
    * data - Data folder with images and data needed for GMail authentication (I think this should to be private but I thrust Udacity)
    * learning/models.py - Learning models developed module
    * learning/stop_words.py - Stop words repository module
    * plugins/gmail.py - GMail integration.
    * conclusion.py - Conclusion benchmark comparision between initial and final implementations.
